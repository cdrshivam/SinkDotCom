# SinkDotCom
A game to sink all of the computer dot coms with minimum number of chances taken. You're given a rating level based on how well you perform.
## Setup : ## 
When the game program is launched, the computer places three DotComs, randomly, on the virtual 7x7 grid. When thats's complete, the game asks for your first guess.
## How to play : ##
The computer will prompt you to enter a guess(a cell) which you'll type at the command-line (as "b3", "b0", "c4"). In response to your guess, you will see a result at the command-line, either HIT, MISS or YOU SUNK DOTCOM. when you've burst/sunk all three Dot Coms, the game ends by printing out your rating.

Ps: I have learn to make this game from the book : Head First Java by Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates
